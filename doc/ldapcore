## LDAP Core

The LDAP Core container is a container used for testing purposes.

It is based on the alpine:latest image and comes with openldap with all backends
and overlays preinstalled.

This container is NOT designed for production purposes (yet).

The directory is empty and configured for basic use.

### Getting Started

Launch the container as following:

```
> docker run -d eduid/ldapcore -p 389:389
```

This will create a volume for your container that contains the directory DB.

The directory comes barebones only with an admin account and no overlays are
activated.

Now you can connect to the directory using the following data:

BaseDN: dc=eduid,dc=io
RootDN: cn=admin,dc=eduid,dc=io
RootPW: secret
